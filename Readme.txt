AIRCRAFT

1.  The working cowl flaps are opened by Ctrl-Shift-V, and closed by Ctrl-Shift-C (both in increments) or use the cowl flaps switch.  Note:  COWL FLAPS MUST BE CLOSED FOR INDIVIDUAL ENGINE START, OR WHEN YOU WANT TO SELECT A SINGLE ENGINE!  This is due to an unfortunate gauge interaction.

2.  The landing lights light the ground properly, and must be extended before use (press the L key, and then press Shift-W), or use the panel switches.

3.  Contrails whenever you want them (press the I key)

REALISTIC ENGINE START

To start the engines realistically, refer to the FS2004 Realistic Engine Start.txt file in the Docs folder.

PANEL:

Panel is included, by Greg Pepper and Tom Gibson.  This panel is a pilot's panel; other engine gauges are on the flight engineer's panel.

Flight Engineer's panel by Bruce Smythe, used with permission.  FE Icon to open the FE panel is just to the left of the other icons in the 2D panel and VC.  Or press Shift 2 to open it.
