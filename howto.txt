STARTING ENGINES:

The official start sequence is 3-4-2-1, but you can start in any sequence with this model.
The magnetos are preset to "3", meaning both are on.  The prop control is preset to "1",
meaning full speed.  Mixture is automatic.  Cowl flaps are automatic.


1)  SHIFT-3, to select engine number 3
2)  Set throttle to about 50%
3)  Hold down "s" key until engine starts running
4)  Release "s" key and set throttle to zero
5)  Repeat the above for engines 4, 2 and 1
6)  SHIFT-`, to select all engines


TAXI:

SHIFT-b to release parking brake. 
"m" key engages nose wheel steering.
Set flaps to FLAP 1 position (15 degrees)
Max takeoff weight is 147,000 lb.



TAKEOFF:

Check parking brake released.
Set power to 56 inches of manifold pressure (red mark on top gauge).
Rotate at 140 kts.
Positive rate of climb - gear up.
Initial climb at 160 kts.
At 500 ft AGL lower nose and raise flaps.


CLIMB:

Set power to 45 inches of manifold pressure (yellow mark on top gauge).
SHIFT-n, until rpm decreases to 2350 (yellow mark on second gauge).
Climb at 175 kts.
Autopilot roll mode:  as required
Autopilot pitch mode:  Hold speed of 175 kts with pitch



CRUISE:

Set power to 38 inches of manifold pressure (green mark on top gauge).
SHIFT-n, until rpm reaches minimum (about 1700 rpm, green mark on second gauge).
Let the speed run.  If above 185 kts consider climbing to next higher altitude.
Autopilot roll mode:  as required
Autopilot pitch mode:  Altitude Hold
Don't use autothrottle, ever.



DESCENT:

Set power to 23 inches of manifold pressure (yellow mark on top gauge).
RPM will still be 1700.
This will give you about 500 fpm descent rate at 190 kts.
If you need a faster descent lower the gear (if speed is < 200 kts).
This will give you about 1300 fpm.
Autopilot roll mode:  as required
Autopilot pitch mode:  Hold vertical speed of 500 (gear up).


APPROACH:

Set power to a minimum of 23 inches of manifold pressure.
Use gear/flaps to attain required descent rate.
Final configuration is gear down, FLAPS 3 (30 degrees).
FLAPS 4 (45 degrees) is available for short field landings.
Set RPM to 2350 (using "n" key).  That's the yellow mark on the second gauge.


LANDING:

Max landing weight is 121,700 lb.
Power can be reduced below 23 inches in the flare.
Use "n" key to set props to max speed.
SHIFT-r to put props in reverse (-10 degrees blade angle).
SHIFT-r to come out of reverse.


TAXI-IN:

Raise flaps.
Kill engines 1 and 4.


PARKING:

Set parking brake.
Kill engine 2.
Kill engine 3 if you have external power available.
